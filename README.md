##Monster Hunter: World Defense Calculator
It's a pretty simple application, but it might prove useful to some players.
It requires Microsoft .NET Frawmework 4.8 to run, which you can download here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48
(You'll want the one that says "Download .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime.")

I pulled the formula for defense damage reduction from https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Defense.
Have fun gamers
